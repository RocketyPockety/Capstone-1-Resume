    <h2>What I Bring to the Team</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> Teamwork
                <ul>
                    <li>My professional experience has relied heavily on frequent cooperation with others to deliver on our shared goal of improving the health and safety of our community.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li> Positive Attitude
                <ul>
                    <li>While it seems at first glance that an attitude is less of a “work skill” and more of a general mindset, I find that working with a positive attitude increases morale, engenders camaraderie, and improves relations between staff members and the community they serve.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li> Time Management
                <ul>
                    <li>Within any healthcare space, there are a plethora of tasks to perform, and never enough time to deliver on all of them; during my career, I have had much experience discerning which tasks take priority, and learning how to make efficient use of my time.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li> Effective Communication
                <ul>
                    <li>My career has allowed me the opportunity to develop strong communication skills, not just to relay information to coworkers, but also to instill the population we serve with confidence and trust that we have their best interests at heart.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li> Critical Thinking & Problem Solving
                <ul>
                    <li>Healthcare is often about dealing with a complex web of interconnected problems, and sometimes requires critical thought to determine the best path forward when delivering care to patients with particularly complicated needs.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li> Adaptability
                <ul>
                    <li>Assisting various units throughout the pandemic has enabled me to become very adaptable, adjusting my workflow to meet the needs of care, policy, interpersonal dynamics, etc. that differ between departments.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li> Attention to Detail
                <ul>
                    <li>The difference between correct and incorrect can sometimes be small, but it can have major lasting impacts if not acted upon. My career has awarded me plenty of opportunity to notice incongruencies, and act upon them accordingly to prevent potential harms from occurring.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li> Microsoft Office 365
                <ul>
                    <li>Though not the most commonly used instrument in my career, I have a sufficient understanding of most Microsoft Office 365 programs, such as Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and Outlook.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li> Eagle Scout
                <ul>
                    <li>During my youth, I spent several years in the Boy Scouts of America, and during that time, worked diligently to achieve the rank of Eagle Scout, the highest honor a young man can achieve within the organization. Earning the rank of Eagle is an incredible commitment, requiring years of leadership, learning, earning merit badges, and organizing a sizeable community service project as a capstone. Only between 4-6% of all Boy Scouts have advanced to the rank of Eagle Scout, which I feel helps display both my aptitude, and my perseverance when it comes to reaching my goals.</li>
                </ul>
